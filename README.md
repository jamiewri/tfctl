# tfctl

## Purpose
This CLI tool is used to orchestrate Terraform Cloud runs. Its goal is not to cover the entire administation of Terraform Cloud, but instead to solve a very simple workflow. 

That workflow is to trigger common actions against workspaces by referencing tags only.

For example, I would like to create a destroy run on all workspace that match the tag 'demo', or I would like to cancel all runs on workspaces that match the tags 'dev'.

If you are looking for a complete CLI tool that orchestrates with Terraform Cloud, I'd recommend that you check out [tecli](https://github.com/awslabs/tecli) and [tfx](https://github.com/straubt1/tfx).

## Requirements
Required environment variables
| Env | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| TFE_ADDRESS | `https://app.terraform.io` by default |
| TFC_ORGANIZATION | The name of your Terraform Cloud organization |
| TFC_TEAM_TOKEN | [Terraform Cloud team token](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens) |


## Example Usage
List all workspaces that match the tag `test`.
```bash
$ tfctl search -t test
Searching organization: devopstower
tfc-aws-network-dev
tfc-aws-virtual-machine-dev
tfc-aws-virtual-machine-prod
tfc-aws-network-prod
```

Run a plan on all workspaces that match the tag `test`.
```bash
$ tfctl plan -t test
Searching organization: devopstower
Targeting the following workspaces [tfc-aws-network-dev]
Plan only started: ws-BvDUwoSB4cELmfmc - run-pt5NodM5GTckfMor
```

Run a destroy on all workspaces that match the tag `test`.
```bash
$ tfctl destroy -t test
Searching organization: devopstower
Targeting the following workspaces [tfc-aws-network-dev]
Destroy run started: ws-BvDUwoSB4cELmfmc - run-kF62JTa21eqQUdjt
```

Cancel (or discard) all runs on all workspaces that match both tags `azure` and `demo`.
```bash
$ tfctl cancel -t azure,demo
Searching organization: devopstower
Targeting the following workspaces [tfc-azure-webapp]
Run cancelled: run-Z7kVEntjzwz3ddMw
Run discarded: run-KUyRJxwJE5fWxEWX
```
